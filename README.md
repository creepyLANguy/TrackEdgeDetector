TrackEdgeDetector

TODO - This readme

Should add instructions on how to use this program. 
(white borders of at least 1px. Track must always be at least 2px wide - I think. Place starting masks with one point on black and one on white, next to eachother. Input image is a purely black and white image, but must NOT be a monochromatic bitmap as we use coloured pixels while processing - though can still use a mono bmp as a middle step to get your final full depth b/w bmp. etc)

Oh, also, FIX THE CORNER BUG!!
