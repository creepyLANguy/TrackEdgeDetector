TrackEdgeDetector

TODO - This readme

Should add instructions on how to use this program. 
(white borders of at least 1px. Track must always be at least 2px wide - I think. Place starting masks with one point on black and one on white, next to eachother, with the masks being the shortest distance from eachother, on corresponding sides of the track. Input image is a purely black and white image, but must NOT be a monochromatic bitmap as we use coloured pixels while processing - though can still use a mono bmp as a middle step to get your final full depth b/w bmp. etc) Prolly just include an image... or some ascii art describing the correct starting states. Hmm... 

Oh, also, FIX THE CORNER BUG!!
